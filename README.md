# hello-world
It is a repository to enter in the world of Git

Okay, now I'm trying something more audacious: to make some changes in a brench and commit them. Maybe it will be very ridiculous, but I'm here to try, and when we try something new, we make mistakes, but that is the life.
Not understanding that we do mistakes is very bad, it don't allow us to learn and be better.
